Traditional appliance control systems, often limited by manual switches or wired remotes, fail to 
offer flexibility, efficiency, and remote monitoring capabilities. These systems are static, require 
physical proximity, and do not integrate well with modern technological advances, such as wireless 
connectivity or IoT. As technology continues to evolve, there is a growing demand for more 
dynamic, user-friendly, and remotely accessible solutions for appliance control and monitoring. 
This project aims to address these limitations by developing a Hybrid-Mode Appliance Control 
and Monitoring System using a touch panel and a Wi-Fi app. The proposed system will allow 
users to control and monitor appliances both locally and remotely, offering a scalable and flexible 
solution that can integrate into future IoT ecosystems. The system will enhance the convenience, 
efficiency, and accessibility of appliance management, making it more adaptable to modern 
lifestyles.
