1. Objectives of the Project: 
• To design and implement UART communication between a PC and the SP601 FPGA evaluation 
board. 
• To use a USB-UART bridge for data transmission between the devices. 
• To design custom transmitter and receiver modules in Verilog. 
• To validate the design through a functional testbench simulation. 
2. Introduction: 
Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) is a widely used serial communication protocol for 
data exchange between devices. Unlike synchronous communication, UART does not require a shared clock 
signal. Instead, it uses start and stop bits for synchronization. 
In this project, we aim to establish UART communication between a PC and an SP601 evaluation board, 
which is based on the Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA, using a USB-UART bridge. This design will help 
demonstrate how UART communication works, utilizing a USB-to-UART converter to interface between the 
FPGA and the PC
