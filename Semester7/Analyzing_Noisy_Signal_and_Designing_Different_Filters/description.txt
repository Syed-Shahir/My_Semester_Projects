filtered versions, making it easier to assess the impact of different filters. 
Provide Customizable Filter Parameters: 
• Allow users to adjust filter parameters such as cutoff frequencies for lowpass, highpass, and band filters, 
enhancing flexibility in signal processing. 
2. Introduction: 
In the field of digital signal processing (DSP), audio signals are often manipulated and filtered to achieve desired 
effects or to remove unwanted noise. Audio filtering plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications, from 
music production to speech enhancement and medical signal processing. The effectiveness of audio processing 
largely depends on the flexibility and precision of the tools used. In this context, a graphical user interface (GUI) 
provides an intuitive way for users to interact with complex signal processing algorithms without requiring deep 
technical expertise. 
This project focuses on the development of an Interactive Audio Filter GUI that allows users to load, visualize, 
filter, and manipulate audio signals in real-time. The system offers a variety of filtering options, including 
Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, Bandstop and Moving Average filters, providing users with the ability to isolate 
or attenuate specific frequencies within an audio signal. Additionally, the system enables real-time noise 
adjustment and removal, simulating different noise conditions and providing an option to restore the original 
signal. 
By integrating advanced signal processing techniques with a user-friendly interface, this project aims to enhance 
the accessibility of audio filtering tools. It provides a flexible platform for exploring the effects of different filters, 
observing their impact in both the time domain (signal waveform) and frequency domain (FFT analysis). The 
system also features a play/pause functionality, enabling users to listen to both the original and filtered audio in 
real-time, making it ideal for audio engineers, researchers, and students. 
The core objective of this project is to provide an easy-to-use but powerful tool for interactive audio signal 
processing. It offers the flexibility to adjust various filter parameters dynamically, making it useful for a range of 
practical applications, from noise reduction in recordings to sound design for multimedia projects. The system is 
designed to be cross-platform, ensuring that it is accessible to a broad audience. 
This project demonstrates the integration of digital signal processing algorithms with a graphical user 
interface, providing both the technical robustness needed for audio processing and the user-cantered design that 
simplifies its operation. It serves as a foundation for further exploration into advanced audio filtering techniques, 
as well as potential applications in other domains such as telecommunications and medical diagnostics.
