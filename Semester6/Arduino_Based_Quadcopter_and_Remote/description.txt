This project details the comprehensive development of a quadcopter controlled by an 
Arduino-based flight system. Utilizing an Arduino UNO paired with an MPU 6050 sensor for 
the flight controller, and Arduino Nano with NRF24L01+ modules for both transmitting and 
receiving signals, we have established a robust control architecture. The transmitter system 
captures joystick inputs and transmits them wirelessly. The receiver processes these signals 
and communicates with the flight controller. The flight controller uses the MPU 6050 data to 
stabilize the quadcopter and adjust motor speeds through ESCs. Mathematical modeling, 
including Newton-Euler equations, supports the theoretical foundation for quadcopter 
dynamics and stabilization using PID control. This setup demonstrates a practical and 
scalable approach to building and controlling quadcopters, emphasizing the integration of 
sensors, wireless communication, and control algorithms.
